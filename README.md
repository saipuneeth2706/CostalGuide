🌊 CoastalGuide - Your Real-Time Beach Weather Companion
Live Site: https://costalguide.onrender.com/

CoastalGuide is a beautifully designed, easy-to-use web application that provides crucial, real-time weather updates for famous beach locations across India. Its primary mission is to help beachgoers, tourists, and locals stay informed about coastal weather conditions, promoting safety and better planning for seaside activities.

🤔 Why CoastalGuide?
Coastal weather can be unpredictable. A sunny day can turn stormy in a matter of hours, posing risks to visitors. CoastalGuide was created to solve this problem by offering a centralized, simple, and aesthetically pleasing platform to check live weather conditions. No more guessing or relying on outdated forecasts—get the data you need, right when you need it.

✨ Core Features
⚡ Real-Time Weather Data: Get live, up-to-the-minute weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric conditions for various Indian beaches.

🔓 Instant & Open Access: We believe safety information should be free and easy to access. That's why CoastalGuide requires no user authentication or login. Just visit the site and get the weather instantly.

💨 Fluid & Engaging UI: The user interface is enhanced with subtle animations powered by GSAP, creating a smooth and enjoyable Browse experience.

🎨 Modern & Responsive Design: Built from the ground up with Tailwind CSS, the application looks and works great on any device, whether you're on a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

📲 Android App Available!
